# CODEX

Welcome to CODEX, an empty repository that now serves as a new home.
This repo can be a playground for experiments, tests, or any kind of
project you might want to build. Feel free to expand it as needed.

Check out `AGENTS-GUIDE.md` and the `AGENTS-EXAMPLE-*` files for tips on
customizing the Codex agent. :sparkles:

## Tools

The repository now includes a simple prototype command line interface in
`codex_cli.py`. The script reads a configuration file from
`~/.codex/config.json`, looks up API keys from environment variables and
prints the chosen provider, model and prompt. Use `-c` to edit the
instructions file used by Codex.
