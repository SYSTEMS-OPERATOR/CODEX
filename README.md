# CODEX

This repository hosts a collection of small experiments and tooling.

## codex CLI

We provide a simple `codex` command that can send a prompt to the OpenAI API.
Install dependencies with `npm install` and run the script like so:

```bash
node bin/codex.js "Hello"
```

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before use.

Check out `AGENTS-GUIDE.md` and the `AGENTS-EXAMPLE-*` files for tips on customizing the Codex agent. :sparkles:
