# CODEX

Welcome to CODEX, an empty repository that now serves as a new home.

This repo can be a playground for experiments, tests, or any kind of
project you might want to build. Feel free to expand it as needed.

Check out `AGENTS-GUIDE.md` and the `AGENTS-EXAMPLE-*` files for tips on
customizing the Codex agent. :sparkles:

## Tools

A minimal Python implementation of the Codex CLI lives in `codex_cli/`. It is inspired by the original [CODEX-CLI project](https://github.com/SYSTEMS-OPERATOR/CODEX-CLI) but greatly simplified.

```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
python -m codex_cli --help
```
