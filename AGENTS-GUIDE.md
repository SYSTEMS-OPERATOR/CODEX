# AGENTS Guide for the CODEX System ðŸš€

This document describes how to use `AGENTS.md` files to influence agent behavior
within the CODEX repository. These files contain instructions that supplement
or override the default system behavior when working with CODEX. The guide
covers the file format, scoping rules, and common prompting techniques.

## 1. Purpose
`AGENTS.md` files allow repository authors to provide per-directory
instructions for the agent. They can be used to enforce code standards,
specify required tests, or outline PR message requirements.

## 2. File Placement and Scope
- Place an `AGENTS.md` in any directory to apply its rules to that directory and
  all of its subdirectories.
- If multiple `AGENTS.md` files apply to the same path, deeper files override
  conflicting instructions from parent directories.
- When no `AGENTS.md` is present, the agent falls back to the system defaults.

## 3. Instruction Format
`AGENTS.md` is plain Markdown. Organize it into clear sections using headings or
lists. The agent does not parse code blocks, so instructions should be written
as regular text. Example sections include **Code Style**, **Testing**, or
**PR Message Guidelines**.

### Example Structure
```
# Code Style
- Follow PEP8.
- Use descriptive variable names.

# Testing
- Run `pytest` before committing.

# PR Message Guidelines
- Summarize code changes.
- Include test results.
```

## 4. Programmatic Checks
Instructions may require the agent to run commands (e.g., `pytest`) after
modifying files. The agent will attempt to run the commands and capture any
output. If commands fail due to environment restrictions (such as missing
packages), the agent includes a standard disclaimer in the PR.

## 5. PR Message Customization
`AGENTS.md` can provide rules about how pull request messages should be
formatted or what sections they must include. These rules apply when the agent
creates a pull request from this repository.

## 6. Standard Prompting Techniques
- **Explicit Steps**: Provide a list of tasks or checks the agent must perform,
  such as linting or running a specific script.
- **Code Constraints**: Specify language or framework versions, code style
  preferences, or forbidden libraries.
- **Commit Scope**: Clarify which files should or should not be modified.

## 7. Advanced Techniques
- **Dynamic Instructions**: Include placeholder text that the agent fills in
  with context-specific information (e.g., the path to a test script).
- **Multiple Examples**: Provide several `AGENTS-EXAMPLE-*.md` files that show
  different configurations for various workflows.
- **Fallback Behavior**: Indicate what the agent should do if required commands
  fail (e.g., add a note to the PR or open an issue).

## 8. Additional Resources
- Review the repository README for project-specific guidelines.
- Combine `AGENTS.md` with continuous integration scripts for best results.

This guide should help you craft your own `AGENTS.md` files to extend the
functionality and quality of your CODEX projects. âœ…
