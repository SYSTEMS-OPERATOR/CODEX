# AGENTS Example 2

This example demonstrates a more involved configuration.

- Lint the project with `flake8`.
- Run `pytest --cov` for test coverage.
- Execute `./scripts/update_readme.sh` after tests pass.
- Commit messages should reference an issue number, e.g., `Fix #12: short description`.
- Summaries for pull requests must include a list of the commands executed.
